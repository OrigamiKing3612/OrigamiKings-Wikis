# OEM Wiki
These are the wiki pages for [OEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/origamikings-enhancement-mod). This wiki is a work in progress

## How to get the new blocks
To get the new blocks you can craft them or use a stonecutter. I would recommend stonecutter because you can get every block, the crafting can't do every block.

## Commands
My mod adds 3 new commands
* `/oem-version`: This command shows the version of OEM you have.
* `/oem-website`: This gives you the link to Modrinth.
* `/oem-issues`: This gives you the link to report any issues in the mod.

## What this mod adds
1. Ladders, barrels, and bookshelves for every kind of wood
2. Stairs, slabs, and walls for concrete and wool, and other various blocks
3. Stairs and slabs for glass
4. Stairs, slabs, and walls for leaves
5. Copper Chains, lanterns, pressure plates, buttons, doors, and trapdoors
    * (All of these oxidize)
    * This also adds armor but it does not oxidize yet.
6. Gold chains and lanterns
7. Azalea wood
8. Vertical slabs for many of the blocks in the game. (more to come)
9. This mod fixes the create new world screen
