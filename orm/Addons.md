# Addons

You can download addons in-game by doing the command `orm-download-addon-(addon name)`. The mod will download the addon and tell you to restart your game.

## If you want to see where the addon mods are downloaded from you can go [here](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod/blob/master/src/main/java/net/origamiking/mcmods/orm/commands/download_addons/DownloadAddonsCommands.java) to look.
