# Cybertron 

You can get to the Cybertron Dimension using a portal made out of compressed energon and lighting it with a spark. ![cybertron_upadate_portal](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod/assets/115757805/72b891f1-151a-48ab-8e7c-bfaeaaca96c3)
When you get there the dimension will loot something like this. ![cybertron_update_cybertron](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod/assets/115757805/a4ae5955-d7a0-4a11-95d1-78e94f73d808)
Every building will have at least one chest with loot. Have fun exploring!
